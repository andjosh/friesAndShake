Yeah, so it is now exceedingly common for sites to use a 'hamburger button' to hide and subsequently reveal a menu.

I would like to point out that there are, at minimum, a couple alternative interaction paradigms to get the job done. A great implementation would probably include a combination of the standard touch/click and the methods below.

[Basic hamburger example](http://jbckmn.github.io/friesAndShake/hamburger/)

### [Fries](http://jbckmn.github.io/friesAndShake/fries/)

> Touch & drag horizontally to open the drawer, touch & drag the opposite direction to close it.

- Supported on touch-enabled devices only.
- Able to start nice drag-hinting like in the iOS 7 camera.
- Able to register the event wherever you like.


### [Shake](http://jbckmn.github.io/friesAndShake/shake/)

> Shake your device horizontally to open the drawer, shake it back to close it up.

- Supported on acceleromter-equipped devices only.
- Significantly reduces thumb injuries induced by hamburger buttons.
- Shake it like a polaroid picture.
